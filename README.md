# 3DCV

This is a basic experiment to make a gallery-like walking 3d experience for showing web work. It features a basic 3d environment with
externally created models, lighting and browser-rendered HTML displayed in 3d space. It's short and dumb and fun.

**Note:** The code is a bit messy. I threw this together very quickly as a proof of concept.

You can probably see it online [here](http://akmw.azurewebsites.net/) unless I've turned the instance off...

My work is in `js/3dcv.js`. Open `index.html` to get going - it won't work in the file:/// protocol.
